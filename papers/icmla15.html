<h3>Abstract</h3>

Markov Logic Networks, a joint inference framework
that combines logical and probabilistic representations,
enable effective modeling of the dependencies that exist between
different instances of a data sample. While its ability to capture
relational dependencies makes it an ideal framework for predicting
the structures inherent in many natural language processing
(NLP) tasks, it is arguably underused in NLP, especially in
comparison to other joint inference frameworks such as integer
linear programming. In this paper, we present the first Markov
logic model for the NLP task of fine-grained opinion extraction
that exploits a factuality lexicon. When evaluated on a standard
evaluation corpus, our approach surpasses a state-of-the-art
approach in performance.
