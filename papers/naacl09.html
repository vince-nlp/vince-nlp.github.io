<H3>Abstract</H3>

  Recent work has shown that explicitly identifying and filtering
  non-anaphoric mentions prior to coreference resolution can 
  improve the performance of a coreference system. 
  We present a novel approach to this task of anaphoricity determination
  based on graph cuts, and demonstrate its superiority to competing
  approaches by comparing their effectiveness in improving a learning-based
  coreference system on the ACE data sets.
