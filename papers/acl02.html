<H3>Abstract</H3>
We present a noun phrase coreference system that extends the work of
Soon et al. (2001) and, to our knowledge, produces the best results to
date on the MUC-6 and MUC-7 coreference resolution data sets -- 
F-measures of 70.4 and 63.4, respectively. Improvements arise from two
sources: extra-linguistic changes to the learning framework and a
large-scale expansion of the feature set to include more sophisticated
linguistic knowledge.
