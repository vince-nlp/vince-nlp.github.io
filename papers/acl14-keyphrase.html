<h3>Abstract</h3>

While automatic keyphrase extraction has been examined extensively, state-of-the-art performance on this task is still much lower than that on many core natural language processing tasks.
We present a survey of the state of the art in automatic keyphrase extraction, examining the major sources of errors 
made by existing systems and discussing the challenges ahead.
