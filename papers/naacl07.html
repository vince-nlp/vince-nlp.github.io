<H3>Abstract</H3>

This paper introduces an unsupervised morphological segmentation algorithm 
that shows robust performance for four languages with different levels of
morphological complexity. In particular, our algorithm outperforms 
Goldsmith's Linguistica and Creutz and Lagus's Morfessor for English and
Bengali, and achieves performance that is comparable to the best results for
all three PASCAL evaluation datasets. Improvements arise from (1) the use
for relative corpus frequency and suffix level similarity for detecting
incorrect morpheme attachments and (2) the induction of orthographic rules
and allomorphs for segmenting words where roots exhibit spelling changes
during morpheme attachments.
