<H3>Abstract</H3>
We introduce cause identification, a new problem involving classification of
incident reports in the aviation domain.
Specifically, given a set of pre-defined causes, a cause identification
system seeks to identify all and only those causes that can explain why
the aviation incident described in a given report occurred.
The difficulty of cause identification stems in part from the fact that it is
a multi-class, multi-label categorization task, 
and in part from the skewness of 
the class distributions and the scarcity of annotated reports.
To improve the performance of a cause identification system for the minority
classes, we present a bootstrapping algorithm that automatically augments
a training set by learning
from a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.
Experimental results show that our algorithm yields a relative error
reduction of 6.3% in F-measure for the minority classes
in comparison to a baseline that learns solely from the labeled data.
