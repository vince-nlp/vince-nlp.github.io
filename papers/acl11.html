<H3>Abstract</H3>

While world knowledge has been shown to improve
learning-based coreference resolvers,
the improvements were typically obtained by incorporating
world knowledge into a fairly weak baseline resolver.
Hence, it is not clear whether these benefits can carry over to 
a stronger baseline.
Moreover, since there has been no attempt to apply different sources
of world knowledge in combination to coreference resolution, it is not
clear whether they offer complementary benefits to a resolver.
We systematically 
compare commonly-used and
under-investigated sources of world knowledge for coreference
resolution by applying them to two learning-based coreference models
and evaluating them on documents annotated with two different annotation schemes.
