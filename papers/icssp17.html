<h3>Abstract</h3>

Software requirement analysis is an essential step in software development
process, which defines what is to be built in a project.
Requirements are mostly written in text and will later evolve to
fine-grained and actionable artifacts with details about system configurations, technology stacks, etc. Tracing the evolution of requirements
enables stakeholders to determine the origin of each
requirement and understand how well the softwareâ€™s design reflects to its requirements. Reckoning requirements traceability is
not a trivial task, we focus on applying machine learning approach
to classify traceability between various associated requirements.
In particular, we investigate a 2-learner, ontology-based approach,
where we train two classifiers to separately exploit two types of
features, lexical features and features derived from a hand-built
ontology. In comparison to a supervised baseline system that uses
only lexical features, our approach yields a relative error reduction
of 25.9%. Most interestingly, results do not deteriorate when the
hand-built ontology is replaced with its automatically constructed
counterpart.
