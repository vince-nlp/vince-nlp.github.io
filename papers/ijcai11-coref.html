<H3>Abstract</H3>

We investigate new methods for creating and applying ensembles for
coreference resolution.
While existing ensembles for coreference resolution are
typically created using different
learning algorithms, clustering algorithms or training sets,
we harness recent advances in coreference modeling and 
propose to create our ensemble from a variety of supervised coreference models.
However, 
the presence of pairwise and non-pairwise coreference models in our
ensemble presents a challenge to its application: it is not
immediately clear how to combine the coreference decisions made by these
models.
We investigate different methods for applying a model-heterogeneous ensemble
for coreference resolution.
Empirical results on the ACE data sets 
demonstrate the promise of ensemble approaches:
all ensemble-based systems significantly 
outperform the best member of the ensemble.
