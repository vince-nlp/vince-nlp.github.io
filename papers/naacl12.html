<H3>Abstract</H3>

To build a coreference resolver for a new language, the typical approach is to first 
coreference-annotate documents from this target language and then train a resolver
on these annotated documents using supervised learning techniques. However, the high cost associated with manually
coreference-annotating documents needed by a supervised approach makes it difficult
to deploy coreference technologies across a large number of natural languages.
To alleviate this corpus annotation bottleneck, we examine a 
translation-based projection approach to multilingual coreference resolution. 
Experimental results on two target languages 
demonstrate the promise of our approach.
