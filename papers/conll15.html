<h3>Abstract</h3>

Software system development is guided by the evolution of requirements.
In this paper, we address the task of <i>requirements traceability</i>, 
which is concerned with providing bi-directional
traceability between various requirements, enabling users to
find the origin of each requirement and track every change made to it.
We propose a <i>knowledge-rich</i> approach to the task, where we extend
a supervised baseline system with (1) additional training instances
derived from human-provided annotator rationales;
and (2) additional features derived from a hand-built ontology.
Experiments demonstrate that 
our approach yields a relative error reduction of 11.1--19.7%.
