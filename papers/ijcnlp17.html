<h3>Abstract</h3>

We propose the first lightly-supervised approach to scoring an argument's
persuasiveness. Key to our approach is the novel hypothesis that 
lightly-supervised persuasiveness scoring is possible by explicitly 
modeling the major errors that negatively impact persuasiveness.
In an evaluation on a new annotated corpus of online debate arguments, our approach rivals its fully-supervised counterparts in performance
by four scoring metrics 
when using only 10% of the available training instances.
