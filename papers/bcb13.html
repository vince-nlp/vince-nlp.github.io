<h3>Abstract</h3>
We examine the task of 
temporal relation classification for the clinical domain. 
Our approach to this task departs from existing ones in that
it is (1) <i>knowledge-rich</i>, employing sophisticated
knowledge derived from semantic and discourse relations, and
(2) <i>hybrid</i>, combining the strengths of rule-based and learning-based approaches. Evaluation results on the i2b2 Clinical Temporal Relations Challenge corpus show that our approach yields a 15-21% and 6-13% relative reduction in error
over a state-of-the-art learning-based baseline system when
gold-standard and automatically identified temporal relations are used, respectively.

The hand-written rules used in the hybrid approach and the pruning heuristics described in this paper are available from <a href="http://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~jld082000/temporal-relations">this page</a>.
