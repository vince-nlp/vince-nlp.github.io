<H3>Abstract</H3>

Traditional clustering algorithms are designed to search for a single clustering 
solution despite the fact that multiple alternative clustering solutions 
might exist for a particular dataset. 
For example, a set of news articles might be clustered by topic or
by the author's gender or age.
Similarly, book reviews might be clustered by sentiment or
comprehensiveness. In this paper, we address
the problem of identifying alternative clustering solutions 
by developing a Probabilistic Multi-Clustering (PMC) model that 
discovers multiple, maximally different clusterings of a data sample.
Empirical results on six datasets representative of real-world applications show that our PMC model exhibits superior performance to 
comparable multi-clustering algorithms.
