<h3>Abstract</h3>

Despite the significant progress on entity coreference resolution observed in recent years,
there is a general lack of understanding of
what has been improved. We present an empirical analysis of state-of-the-art resolvers with
the goal of providing the general NLP audience with a better understanding of the state
of the art and coreference researchers with directions for future research.
