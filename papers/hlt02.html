<H3>Abstract</H3>
To aid analysts in detecting discrepancies in numeric estimates in
news articles from multiple sources, we propose the automatic
generation of hypertext summaries that include a high-level textual
overview; tables of all <i>comparable</i> numeric estimates, organized
to highlight discrepancies; and targeted access to supporting
information from the original articles. The RIPTIDES system, which
exemplifies the more flexible human-computer interface we propose,
combines information extraction and multidocument summarization
techniques to produce such hypertext summaries. In evaluating the
system's ability to facilitate discrepancy detection, we find that, on
average, the hypertext summaries provide a significantly more complete
picture of the available information than the latest article.
