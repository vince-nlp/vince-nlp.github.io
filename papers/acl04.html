<H3>Abstract</H3>
Knowledge of the anaphoricity of a noun phrase might be profitably
exploited by a coreference system to bypass the resolution of 
non-anaphoric noun phrases. 
Perhaps surprisingly,
recent attempts to incorporate automatically acquired
anaphoricity information into coreference systems, however, 
have led to the degradation in resolution performance.
This paper examines several key issues in computing
and using anaphoricity information to improve learning-based 
coreference systems. 
In particular, we present a new corpus-based approach to 
anaphoricity determination.
Experiments on three standard coreference data sets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
