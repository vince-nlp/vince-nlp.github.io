<H3>Abstract</H3>

Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC), the most influential framework for
software defect classification and analysis, provides valuable in-process
feedback to system development and maintenance. Conducting ODC classification
on existing organizational defect reports is human-intensive and rquires
experts' knowledge of both ODC and system domains. This paper presents AutoODC,
an approach and tool for automating ODC classification by casting it as 
a supervised text classification problem. Rather than merely applying the
standard machine learning framework to this task, we seek to acquire a better
ODC classification system by integrating experts' ODC experience and domain
knoweldge into the learning process via proposing a novel Relevance Annotation
Framework. We evalauted AutoODC on an industrial defect report from the social
network domain. AutoODC is a promising approach: not only does it leverage
minimal human effort beyong the human annotations typically required by
standard machine learning approaches, but it achieves an overall accuracy
of 80.2% when using manual classifications as a basis of comparison.
