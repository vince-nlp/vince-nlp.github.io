<H3>Abstract</H3>
We report on two preliminary evaluations of RIPTIDES, a system that
combines information extraction (IE), extraction-based summarization,
and natural language generation to support user directed multidocument
summarization. We report first on a case study of the system's ability
to detect discrepancies in numerical estimates appearing in different
new articles at different time points in the evolution of a story using a
corpus of more than 100 articles from multiple sources about an
earthquake in Central America in January 2001. We then report on how
our domain-independent extraction-based summarizer performed on the DUC
multidocument task, discussing the extent to which we were able to
improve cohesion and organization over the baseline, without unduly
sacrificing content relevance.
