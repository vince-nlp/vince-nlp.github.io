<H3>Abstract</H3>

Recent research efforts have led to the development of a state-of-the-art
supervised coreference model, the cluster-ranking model. However, 
it is not clear whether the features
that have been shown to be useful when employed in traditional coreference
models will fare equally well in this new model. 
Rather than merely re-evaluate them using the cluster-ranking model,
we examine two 
interesting types of features derived
from syntactic parses, tree-based features and path-based features, and
discuss the challenges involved in employing them in the 
cluster-ranking model.
Experimental 
results on a set of Switchboard dialogues show their 
effectiveness when used in combination with the
cluster-ranking model: using them to augment a baseline coreference feature 
set results in a 8.6-11.7% reduction in relative error.
