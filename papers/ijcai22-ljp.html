<h3>Abstract</h3>

Automatic legal judgment prediction (LJP) has recently received increasing attention in the natural language processing community in part because of its practical values as well as the associated research challenges. We present an overview of the major milestones made in LJP research covering multiple jurisdictions
and multiple languages, and conclude with promising future research directions.
