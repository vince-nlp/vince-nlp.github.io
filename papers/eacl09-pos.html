<H3>Abstract</H3>

This paper examines unsupervised approaches to part-of-speech (POS) tagging
for morphologically-rich, resource-scarce languages, 
with an emphasis 
on Goldwater and Griffiths's (2007) nonparametric
fully-Bayesian approach originally developed for English POS tagging.
We argue that existing unsupervised POS taggers unrealistically assume
as input a perfect POS lexicon, and
consequently, we propose a weakly supervised fully-Bayesian 
approach to POS tagging, which 
relaxes the unrealistic assumption by automatically acquiring the lexicon from a small amount of POS-tagged data.
Since such relaxation comes at the expense of a drop in tagging accuracy, we
propose two extensions to the Bayesian framework and 
demonstrate that they are effective 
in improving 
a fully-Bayesian POS tagger for Bengali, our
representative morphologically-rich, resource-scarce language.
