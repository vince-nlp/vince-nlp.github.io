<h3>Abstract</h3>


In this paper, we provide an overview of the CODI-CRAC Shared Task. The shared task focuses on detecting anaphoric relations in different genres of conversations. Using five conversational datasets, four of which have been newly annotated with a wide range of anaphoric relations: identity, bridging references and discourse deixis, we defined multiple tasks focusing individually on these key relations. We discuss the evaluation scripts used to assess the system performance on these tasks, and provide a brief summary of the participating systems and the results obtained across 115 runs from six teams, with most submissions achieving significantly better results than our baseline methods.
