<h3>Abstract</h3>

Recent years have seen increasing attention on Legal Case Retrieval (LCR), a key task in the area of Legal AI that concerns the retrieval of cases from a large legal database of historical cases that are similar to a given query. This paper presents a survey of the major milestones made in LCR research, targeting researchers who are finding their way into the field and seek a brief account of the relevant datasets and the recent neural models and their performances.
