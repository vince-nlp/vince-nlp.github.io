<H3>Abstract</H3>

Although it is common practice to produce only a single clustering of a dataset, 
in many cases text documents can be clustered along different dimensions. 
Unfortunately, not only do traditional text clustering algorithms fail to produce multiple clusterings of a dataset, 
the only clustering they produce may not be the one that the user desires. 
In this paper, we propose a simple active clustering algorithm that is capable of producing multiple clusterings of the same data 
according to user interest. In comparison to previous work on feedback-oriented clustering, 
the amount of user feedback required by our algorithm is minimal. 
In fact, the feedback turns out to be as simple as a cursory look at a list of 
words.
Experimental results are very promising: our system is able to generate 
clusterings along the user-specified dimensions with reasonable accuracies 
on several challenging text classification tasks, 
thus providing suggestive evidence that our approach is viable.
