<h3>Abstract</h3>

Virtually all the commonly-used evaluation metrics for entity coreference resolution are linguistically agnostic, treating the mentions to be clustered as generic rather than linguistic objects. We argue that the performance of a mention coreference resolver cannot be accurately reflected when it is evaluated using linguistically agnostic metrics. Consequently, we propose a framework for incorporating linguistic awareness into commonly-used coreference evaluation metrics.
