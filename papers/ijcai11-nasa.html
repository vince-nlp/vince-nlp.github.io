<H3>Abstract</H3>
In the aviation safety research domain, 
cause identification refers to the task 
of identifying the possible causes responsible for the incident
described in an aviation safety incident report. 
This task presents a number of challenges, including the scarcity of labeled data and the difficulties in finding the relevant portions of the text. We investigate the use of annotator rationales
to overcome 
these challenges, proposing
several 
new ways of utilizing 
rationales 
and showing that through judicious use of the rationales, 
it is possible to achieve significant improvement over a 
unigram SVM baseline.
