<h3>Abstract</h3>

Recent work on 
argument persuasiveness has focused on 
determining <i>how</i> persuasive an argument is. Oftentimes, however, it is
equally important to understand <i>why</i> an argument is unpersuasive, as
it would be difficult for an author to know how to improve her argument's
persuasiveness without knowing the errors that made it unpersuasive.
Motivated by this practical concern, we (1) annotate a corpus of
debate comments with not only their persuasiveness scores but also the errors 
they contain, (2) propose an approach to persuasiveness scoring and error identification that outperforms competing baselines, and (3) show that the persuasiveness scores computed by our approach can indeed be explained by the errors it identifies.
