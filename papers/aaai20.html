<h3>Abstract</h3>

Recent years have seen significant advances in machine perception, which have enabled AI systems to become grounded
in the world. While AI systems can now "read" and "see",
they still cannot read between the lines and see through the
lens, unlike humans. We propose the novel task of hidden
message and intention identification: given some perceptual
input (i.e., a text, an image), the goal is to produce a short
description of the message the input transmits and the hidden
intention of its author, if any. Not only will a solution to this
task enable machine perception technologies to reach the next
level of complexity, but it will be an important step towards
addressing a task that has recently received a lot of public
attention, political manipulation in social media.
