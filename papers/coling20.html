<h3>Abstract</h3>

Bridging reference resolution is an anaphora resolution task that is arguably more challenging
and less studied than entity coreference resolution. Given that significant progress has been
made on coreference resolution in recent years, we believe that bridging resolution will receive
increasing attention in the NLP community. Nevertheless, progress on bridging resolution is
currently hampered in part by the scarcity of large annotated corpora for model training as well
as the lack of standardized evaluation protocols. This paper presents a survey of the current state
of research on bridging reference resolution and discusses future research directions.
