<H3>Abstract</H3>
Successful application of multi-view co-training algorithms relies on
  the ability to factor the available features into views that are 
  compatible and uncorrelated. This can potentially preclude their
  use on problems such as coreference resolution that lack 
  an obvious feature split. 
  To bootstrap coreference classifiers, we propose and evaluate a
  single-view weakly supervised algorithm that relies on two different
  learning algorithms in lieu of the two different views required by
  co-training. In addition, we
  investigate a method for ranking unlabeled instances to be fed back
  into the bootstrapping loop as labeled data, aiming to alleviate the
  problem of performance deterioration that is commonly observed in
  the course of bootstrapping.
