<h3>Abstract</h3>

While exaggeration is one of the most prevalent rhetorical devices, it is arguably one of the least studied in the figurative language
processing community. We contribute to the
computational study of exaggeration by (1)
creating the first Chinese corpus focusing on
sentence-level hyperbole detection, with the
goal of facilitating a cross-lingual study on
this phenomenon, (2) performing a statistical
and manual analysis of our corpus, with the
goal of gaining insights into the strategies humans employ when creating hyperboles, and
(3) addressing the automatic hyperbole detection task with deep learning techniques.
