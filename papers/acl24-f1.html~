<h3>Abstract</h3>

While significant progress has been made on the task of Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) in recent years, the incorrect predictions made by SOTA LJP models can be attributed in part to their failure to (1) locate the key event information that determines the judgment, and (2) exploit the cross-task consistency constraints that exist among the subtasks of LJP. To address these weaknesses, we propose <i>EPM</i>, an Event-based Prediction Model with constraints, which surpasses existing SOTA models in performance on a standard LJP dataset.
