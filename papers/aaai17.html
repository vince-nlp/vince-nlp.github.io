<h3>Abstract</h3>

Though extensively investigated since the 1960s, entity coreference
resolution, a core task in natural language understanding,
is far from being solved. Nevertheless, significant
progress has been made on learning-based coreference research
since its inception two decades ago. This paper provides
an overview of the major milestones made in learningbased
coreference research and discusses a hard entity coreference
task, the Winograd Schema Challenge, which has recently
received a lot of attention in the AI community.
