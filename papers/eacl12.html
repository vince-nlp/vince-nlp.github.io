<H3>Abstract</H3>

While information status (IS) plays a crucial role in discourse processing,
there have only been a handful of attempts 
to automatically determine the IS of discourse entities.
We examine a related but more challenging task, 
<i>fine-grained</i> IS determination, which involves
classifying a discourse entity as one of 16 IS <i>subtypes</i>.
We investigate the use of rich knowledge sources for this task
in combination with a rule-based approach and a learning-based approach.
In experiments with a set of Switchboard dialogues,
the learning-based approach achieves an accuracy of 78.7%, 
outperforming the rule-based approach by 21.3%.
