<h3>Abstract</h3>

Pronoun resolution and common noun phrase resolution are the two most challenging
subtasks of coreference resolution. While a lot of work has focused on
pronoun resolution, common noun phrase resolution has almost always been tackled
in the context of the larger coreference resolution task. In fact,
to our knowledge, there has been no attempt to address
Chinese common noun phrase resolution as a standalone task.
In this paper, we propose a generative model for unsupervised Chinese 
common noun phrase resolution that not only 
allows easy incorporation of linguistic
constraints on coreference but also performs joint resolution and anaphoricity
determination.
When evaluated on
the Chinese portion of the OntoNotes 5.0 corpus, our model rivals
its supervised counterpart in performance.
