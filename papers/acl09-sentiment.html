<H3>Abstract</H3>

Supervised polarity classification systems are typically domain-specific.
Building these systems involves the expensive process of
annotating a large amount of data for each domain.
A potential solution to this corpus annotation bottleneck is to build
unsupervised polarity classification systems.
However, 
unsupervised learning of polarity is difficult, owing in part
to the prevalence of sentimentally ambiguous reviews, where reviewers
discuss both the positive and negative aspects of a product. 
To address this problem, we propose a semi-supervised approach
to sentiment classification where we first mine the unambiguous reviews
using spectral techniques
and then exploit them to classify the ambiguous reviews via a novel
combination of active learning, transductive learning, and ensemble learning.
