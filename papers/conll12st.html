<H3>Abstract</H3>

We describe our system for the CoNLL-2012 shared task, which seeks
to model coreference in OntoNotes for English, Chinese, and Arabic.
We adopt a hybrid approach to coreference resolution, combining the strengths of rule-based methods and learning-based methods. 
Our official combined score over all three languages is 56.35.
In particular, our score on the Chinese test set is the best among the participating teams.
