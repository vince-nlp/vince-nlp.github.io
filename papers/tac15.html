<h3>Abstract</h3>

We describe UTD's system participated in the event nugget detection and coreference task at TAC-KBP 2015. We designed and implemented a pipeline system that consists of three components: event nugget identification and subtyping, REALIS value identification, and event coreference resolution. In particular, we proposed a multi-pass sieve approach to event coreference resolution. UTD's system achieved F1 scores of 57.45, 45.21, and 32.36 on those three components, respectively.
