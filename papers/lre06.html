<H3>Abstract</H3>

Unsupervised morphological analysis is the task of segmenting words into 
prefixes,
suffixes and roots without prior knowledge of language-specific morphotactics
and morpho-phonological rules. This paper introduces a simple, yet highly
effective algorithm for unsupervised morphological learning for Bengali, an
Indo-Aryan language that is highly inflectional in nature. 
When evaluated on a set of 4110 human-segmented Bengali words, our algorithm
achieves an F-score of 83%, substantially outperforming Linguistica, one of
the most widely-used unsupervised morphological analyzers, by about 23%.
