<h3>Abstract</h3>

We propose an unsupervised probabilistic 
model for zero pronoun resolution.
To our knowledge, this is the first such model that
(1) is trained on zero pronouns in an unsupervised manner;
(2) jointly identifies and resolves anaphoric zero pronouns; and
(3) exploits discourse information provided by a salience model.
Experiments demonstrate that our unsupervised model 
significantly outperforms 
its state-of-the-art unsupervised counterpart when 
resolving the Chinese zero pronouns in the OntoNotes corpus.
