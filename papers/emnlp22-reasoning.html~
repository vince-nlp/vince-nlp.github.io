<h3>Abstract</h3>

We present DiscoSense, a benchmark
for commonsense reasoning via understanding a wide variety of discourse connectives. We generate compelling distractors in
DiscoSense using Conditional Adversarial Filtering, an extension of Adversarial Filtering that employs conditional generation. We show
that state-of-the-art pre-trained language models struggle
to perform well on DiscoSense, which makes
this dataset ideal for evaluating next-generation
commonsense reasoning systems.
