<h3>Abstract</h3>

This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of SinoCoreferencer, a publicly-available end-to-end ACE-style Chinese event coreference system that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ACE 2005 corpus.
SinoCoreferencer comprises eight information extraction system components, including those for entity extraction, entity coreference resolution, and event extraction. Its modular design makes it possible to run each component in a standalone manner, thus facilitating the development of high-level Chinese natural language applications that make use of any of these core information extraction components. To our knowledge, SinoCoreferencer is the first publicly-available Chinese event coreference resolution system.

<H3>Software</H3>
SinoCoreferencer, an event coreference tool that implements all the major
components of the standard information extraction pipeline, is available from
<a href="http://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~yzcchen/coreference">this</a> page.
Each system component can be run in a standalone manner, so even if you are
not interested in event coreference, you may find some of these components
useful when building your own high-level Chinese NLP application.
