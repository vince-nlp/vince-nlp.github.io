<h3>Abstract</h3>

Owing in part to the surge of interest in temporal relation extraction, a number of datasets 
manually annotated with temporal relations between event-event pairs and event-time pairs 
have been produced recently. However, it is not uncommon to find missing annotations in 
these manually annotated datasets. Many researchers attributed this problem to "annotator fatigue". 
While some of these missing relations can be recovered automatically, many of them cannot. 
Our goals in this paper are to (1) manually annotate certain types of missing links that cannot be 
automatically recovered in the i2b2 Clinical Temporal Relations Challenge Corpus, 
one of the recently released evaluation corpora for temporal relation extraction; 
and (2) empirically determine the usefulness of these additional annotations. We will make our 
annotations publicly available, in hopes of enabling a more accurate evaluation of temporal relation 
extraction systems.
