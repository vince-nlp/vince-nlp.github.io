<H3>Abstract</H3>
Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) is an unexpected death caused by loss of 
heart function when the electrical impulses fired from the ventricles become
irregular. Most common SCDs are caused by cardiac arrhythmias and coronary heart
disease. They are mainly due to Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), myocardial
ischaemia and cardiac arrhythmia. This paper aims at automating
the recognition of ST-segment deviations and transient ST episodes which
helps in the diagnosis of myocardial ischaemia and also classifying major
cardiac arrhythmia. Our approach is based on the application of signal
processing and artificial intelligence to the heart signal known as the
ECG (Electrocardiogram). We propose an improved morphological feature 
vector including ST-segment information for heart beat classification
by supervised learning using the support vector machine learning
approach. Our system has been tested and yielded an accuracy of 93.33%
for the ST episode detection on the European ST-T Database and 
96.35% on MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database for classifying six major groups,
i.e., Normal, Ventricular, Atrial, Fusion, Right Bundle and Left Bundle
Branch Block beats.
