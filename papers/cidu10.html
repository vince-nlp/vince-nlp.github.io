<H3>Abstract</H3>
Active learning has been successfully applied
to many natural language processing tasks for obtaining annotated data
in a cost-effective manner.
We propose several extensions to an active learner that adopts the
margin-based uncertainty sampling framework. Experimental results on
a cause detection problem involving
the classification of aviation safety reports
demonstrate the effectiveness of our extensions.
