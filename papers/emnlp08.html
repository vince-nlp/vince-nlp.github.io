<H3>Abstract</H3>

We present a generative model for unsupervised
coreference resolution that views coreference as an EM clustering process.
For comparison purposes, we revisit Haghighi and Klein's (2007)
fully-generative Bayesian model for unsupervised coreference resolution,  
discuss its potential weaknesses and 
consequently propose three modifications to their model.
Experimental results on the ACE data sets show that our model outperforms
their original model by a large margin and compares favorably to the 
modified model.
