<H3>Abstract</H3>

This paper focuses on the linguistic aspect of noun phrase coreference,
investigating the knowledge sources that can potentially improve a
learning-based coreference resolution system.
Unlike traditional, knowledge-lean coreference resolvers, which rely almost
exclusively on morpho-syntactic cues, we show how to induce features 
that encode semantic knowledge from labeled and unlabeled corpora.
Experiments on the ACE data sets indicate that the addition of
these new semantic features to a coreference system employing a fairly
standard feature set significantly improves its performance.
