<H3>Abstract</H3>

Automated essay scoring is one of the most
important educational applications of natural
language processing.  Recently, researchers
have begun exploring methods of scoring essays 
with respect to particular dimensions of 
quality such as coherence, technical errors, 
and relevance to prompt, but there is 
relatively little work on modeling 
organization.  We present a new annotated 
corpus and propose heuristic-based and learning-based
approaches to scoring essays along the organization dimension, 
utilizing techniques that involve sequence alignment, alignment 
kernels, and string kernels.
