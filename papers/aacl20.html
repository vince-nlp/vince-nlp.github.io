<h3>Abstract</h3>

Existing event coreference resolvers have
largely focused on exploiting the information
extracted from the local contexts of the event
mentions under consideration. Hypothesizing
that non-local information could also be useful
for event coreference resolution, we present
two extensions to a state-of-the-art joint event
coreference model that involve incorporating
(1) a supervised topic model for improving
trigger detection by providing global context,
and (2) a preprocessing module that seeks to
improve event coreference by discarding unlikely candidate antecedents of an event mention using discourse contexts computed based
on salient entities. The resulting model yields
the best results reported to date on the KBP
2017 English and Chinese datasets.
