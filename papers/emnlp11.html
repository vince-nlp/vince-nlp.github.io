<H3>Abstract</H3>

An entity in a dialogue may be old, new, or 
mediated/inferrable with respect to the hearer's beliefs.
Knowing the information status of the entities participating in a 
dialogue can therefore facilitate its interpretation. 
We address the under-investigated problem of automatically determining the
information status of discourse entities.
Specifically,
we extend Nissim's (2006) machine learning approach
to information-status determination with lexical and structured features,
and exploit learned knowledge of the
information status of each discourse entity for
coreference resolution.
Experimental results on a set of Switchboard dialogues reveal that
(1) incorporating our proposed features into Nissim's
feature set enables our system to achieve state-of-the-art
performance on information-status classification,
and (2) the resulting information can be used to improve
the performance of learning-based coreference resolvers.
