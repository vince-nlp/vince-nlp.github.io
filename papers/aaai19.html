<h3>Abstract</h3>

The focus of automatic text summarization research has exhibited
a gradual shift from extractive methods to abstractive
methods in recent years, owing in part to advances in neural
methods. Originally developed for machine translation, neural
methods provide a viable framework for obtaining an abstract
representation of the meaning of an input text and generating
informative, fluent, and human-like summaries. This
paper surveys existing approaches to abstractive summarization,
focusing on the recently developed neural approaches.
