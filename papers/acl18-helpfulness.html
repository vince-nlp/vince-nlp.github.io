<h3>Abstract</h3>

As the popularity of free-form usergenerated
reviews in e-commerce and review
websites continues to increase, there
is a growing need for automatic mechanisms
that sift through the vast number of
reviews and identify quality content. Online
review helpfulness modeling and prediction
is a task which studies the factors
that determine review helpfulness and attempts
to accurately predict it. This survey
paper provides an overview of the most
relevant work on product review helpfulness
prediction and understanding in the
past decade, discusses gained insights, and
provides guidelines for future research.
