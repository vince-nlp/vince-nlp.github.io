<h3>Abstract</h3>

State-of-the-art Chinese zero pronoun resolution systems 
are supervised, thus relying on training data containing manually resolved
zero pronouns. To eliminate the reliance on annotated data, we present a
generative model for unsupervised Chinese zero pronoun resolution.
At the core of our model is a novel hypothesis: a probabilistic pronoun resolver trained on overt pronouns in an unsupervised manner can be used to resolve zero pronouns. Experiments demonstrate that our unsupervised model 
rivals its state-of-the-art supervised counterparts in performance when resolving the Chinese zero pronouns in the OntoNotes corpus.
