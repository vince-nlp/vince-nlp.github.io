<h3>Abstract</h3>
While traditional work on anaphora resolution has focused on
resolving anaphors in newspaper and newswire articles, the surge of interest in
biomedical natural language processing in recent years has stimulated work on
anaphora resolution in biomedical texts. Existing anaphora resolvers, whether applied
to the biomedical domain or not, have adopted either a learning-based or a
rule-based approach. We hypothesize that both approaches have their unique
strengths, and propose in this paper a hybrid approach to anaphora resolution
in biomedical texts that aims to combine their strengths. Our hybrid approach
achieves an F-score of 60.9 on the BioNLP-2011 coreference dataset, which to
our knowledge is the best result reported to date on this dataset.
