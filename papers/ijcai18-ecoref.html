<h3>Abstract</h3>

Recent years have seen a gradual shift of focus from
entity-based tasks to event-based tasks in information
extraction research. Being a core event-based
task, event coreference resolution is less studied
but arguably more challenging than entity coreference
resolution. This paper provides an overview
of the major milestones made in event coreference
research since its inception two decades ago.
