<H3>Abstract</H3>
Research in named entity recognition
and mention detection has typically involved a fairly small number of
semantic classes, which may not be adequate if
semantic class information is intended to support 
natural language applications.
Motivated by this observation, we examine the under-studied problem of 
semantic subtype induction, where the goal is to automatically determine 
which of a set of 92 fine-grained semantic classes a noun phrase belongs to.
We seek to improve the standard supervised 
approach to this problem using two
techniques: hierarchical classification and collective classification.
Experimental results 
demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques,
whether or not they are applied in isolation or in combination
with the standard approach.

<H3>Train-test split</H3>
Here are the lists of names of the 200 files from the BBN Pronoun Coreference Corpus (LDC2005T33) that we used for <a href="train-coling10.txt">training</a> and <a href="test-coling10.txt">testing</a>. Note that we only used those files in LDC2005T33 that have corresponding .sense files in the LDC2008T04 corpus.
