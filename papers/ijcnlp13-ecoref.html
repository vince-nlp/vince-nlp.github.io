<h3>Abstract</h3>

Given the relatively small amount of work on event coreference resolution, our
understanding of the task is arguably fairly limited.
This makes it difficult to
determine how to improve an event coreference resolver. 
We seek to gain a better understanding of the state of the art in
event coreference resolution by 
performing the first publicly available analysis of
a Chinese event coreference resolver.
