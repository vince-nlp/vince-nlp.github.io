<h3>Abstract</h3>

Argument persuasiveness is one of the most important
dimensions of argumentative essay quality,
yet it is little studied in automated essay scoring
research. Using a recently released corpus of essays
that are simultaneously annotated with argument
components, argument persuasiveness scores,
and attributes of argument components that impact
an argumentâ€™s persuasiveness, we design the first
set of neural models that predict the persuasiveness
of an argument and its attributes in a student essay,
enabling useful feedback to be provided to students
on why their arguments are (un)persuasive in addition
to how persuasive they are.
