<h3>Abstract</h3>

While recent years have seen a surge of interest
in automated essay grading, including
work on grading essays with respect
to particular dimensions such as prompt
adherence, coherence, and technical quality,
there has been relatively little work
on grading the essay dimension of argument
strength, which is arguably the most
important aspect of argumentative essays.
We introduce a new corpus of argumentative
student essays annotated with argument
strength scores and propose a supervised,
feature-rich approach to automatically
scoring the essays along this
dimension. Our approach significantly
outperforms a baseline that relies solely
on heuristically applied sentence argument
function labels by up to 16.1%.
