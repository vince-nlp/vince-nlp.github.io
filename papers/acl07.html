<H3>Abstract</H3>

This paper examines whether a learning-based coreference resolver can be
improved using semantic class knowledge that is automatically acquired from
a version of the Penn Treebank in which the noun phrases are labeled with
their semantic classes. Experiments on the ACE test data show that a resolver
that employs such induced semantic class knowledge yields a statistically
significant improvement of 2% in F-measure over one that exploits
heuristically computed semantic class knowledge. In addition, the induced
knowledge improves the accuracy of common noun resolution by 2-6%.
