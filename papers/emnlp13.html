<h3>Abstract</h3>

We extend Zhao and Ng's (2007) state-of-the-art 
Chinese anaphoric zero pronoun (AZP) resolver by
(1) using a richer set of features and
(2) exploiting the coreference links between zero pronouns during
resolution.
Results on OntoNotes show that our approach 
significantly outperforms two state-of-the-art AZP resolvers. 
To our knowledge, this is the first work to report results obtained
by an <i>end-to-end</i> Chinese zero pronoun resolver.
