<H3>Abstract</H3>
We investigate single-view algorithms as an alternative to multi-view         
algorithms for weakly supervised learning for natural language                
processing tasks without a natural feature split.  In particular, we          
apply co-training, self-training, and EM to one such task and find            
that both self-training and FS-EM, a new variation of EM that                 
incorporates feature selection, outperform co-training and are          
comparatively less sensitive to parameter changes.
