<h3>Abstract</h3>

Despite the successes of distant supervision approaches to relation extraction in the news domain, the lack of a comprehensive ontology of medical relations makes it difficult to apply such approaches to relation classification in the medical domain. In light of this difficulty, we propose an ensemble approach to this task where we exploit human-supplied knowledge to guide the design of members of the ensemble. Results on the 2010 i2b2/VA Challenge corpus show that our
ensemble approach yields a 19.8% relative error reduction over a state-of-the-art baseline.
