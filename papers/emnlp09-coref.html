<H3>Abstract</H3>

  Traditional learning-based coreference resolvers operate by training a mention-pair
  classifier for determining whether two mentions are coreferent or not.
  Two independent lines of recent research have attempted to improve these
  mention-pair classifiers, one by learning a mention-ranking model
  to rank preceding mentions for a given anaphor,
  and the other by training an entity-mention classifier to 
  determine 
  whether a preceding cluster is coreferent with a given mention.
  We propose a cluster-ranking approach to coreference resolution that
  combines the strengths of mention rankers and entity-mention models.
  We additionally show how our cluster-ranking framework naturally allows 
  anaphoricity determination to be learned jointly with coreference 
  resolution.
  Experimental results on the ACE data sets demonstrate its superior
  performance to competing approaches.

CherryPicker, a coreference tool that implements the cluster-ranking
model described in this paper, is available from
