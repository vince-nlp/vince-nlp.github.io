<H3>Abstract</H3>

State-of-the-art approaches for unsupervised keyphrase extraction are typically evaluated on a single dataset with a single parameter setting.
Consequently, it is unclear how effective these approaches are on a new dataset 
from a different domain, and how sensitive they are to
changes in parameter settings.
To gain a better understanding of state-of-the-art unsupervised keyphrase 
extraction algorithms, we conduct a systematic evaluation and analysis of 
these algorithms on a variety of standard evaluation datasets.

state-of-the-art unsupervised keyphrase extraction algorithms, is available
