<h3>Abstract</h3>

Recently, researchers
have begun exploring methods of scoring student essays 
with respect to particular dimensions of 
quality such as coherence, technical errors, 
and relevance to prompt, but there is 
relatively little work on modeling 
thesis clarity.  We present a new annotated 
corpus and propose a learning-based
approach to scoring essays along the thesis 
clarity dimension.  Additionally, in order
to provide more valuable feedback on why
an essay is scored as it is, we propose
a second learning-based approach to identifying
what kinds of errors an essay has that may lower
its thesis clarity score.
