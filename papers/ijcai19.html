<h3>Abstract</h3>

Despite being investigated for over 50 years, the task of automated essay scoring continues to draw a lot of attention in the natural language processing community in part because of its commercial and educational values as well as the associated research challenges.
This paper presents an overview of the major milestones made in automated essay scoring research since its inception.
