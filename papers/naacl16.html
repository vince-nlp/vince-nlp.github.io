<h3>Abstract</h3>

Understanding the argumentative structure of a persuasive essay involves
addressing two challenging tasks: identifying the components
of the essay's argument and identifying the
relations that occur between them.
We examine the under-investigated task of <i>end-to-end</i> argument mining
in persuasive student essays, where we  
(1) present the first results on end-to-end argument mining in student
essays using a <i>pipeline</i> approach;
(2) address error propagation inherent in the pipeline approach by
performing <i>joint inference</i> over the outputs of the tasks 
in an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) framework; and
(3) propose a novel objective function
that enables F-score to be maximized directly by an ILP solver.
We evaluate our joint-inference approach with our novel objective function 
on a publicly-available corpus of 90 essays, where it yields 
an 18.5% relative error reduction in F-score 
over the pipeline system.
