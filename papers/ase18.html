<h3>Abstract</h3>

It is time-consuming and labor-intensive to learn and locate the
correct API for programming tasks. Thus, it is beneficial to perform
API recommendation automatically. The graph-based statistical
model has been shown to recommend top-10 API candidates effectively.
It falls short, however, in accurately recommending an
actual top-1 API. To address this weakness, we propose RecRank,
an approach and tool that applies a novel ranking-based discriminative
approach leveraging API usage path features to improve
top-1 API recommendation. Empirical evaluation on a large corpus
of (1385+8) open source projects shows that RecRank significantly
improves top-1 API recommendation accuracy and mean reciprocal
rank when compared to state-of-the-art API recommendation
approaches.
