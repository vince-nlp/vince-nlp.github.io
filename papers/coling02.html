<H3>Abstract</H3>
We present a supervised learning approach to the identification of
anaphoric and non-anaphoric noun phrases and show how such information
can be incorporated into a coreference resolution system. The
resulting system outperforms the best MUC-6 and MUC-7 coreference
resolution systems on the corresponding MUC coreference data sets -- 
F-measures of 66.2 and 64.0, respectively.
