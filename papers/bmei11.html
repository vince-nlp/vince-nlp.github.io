<H3>Abstract</H3>

The focus of this paper is to develop a software-hardware platform that 
addresses one of the most costly, acute health conditions, pressure ulcers -
or bed sores. Caring for pressure ulcers is extremely costly, increases the
length of hospital stays and is very labor intensive. The proposed platform
collects information from various sensors incorporated into the bed, analyzes
the data to create a time-stamped, whole-body pressure distribution map, and
commands the bed's actuators to periodically adjust its surface profile to 
redistribute pressure over the entire body. These capabilities are combined 
to form a cognitive support system that augments the ability of care givers,
allowing them to provide better care to more patients in less time. For proof
of concept, we have implemented algorithms and architectures that cover four
key aspects of this platform: 1) data collection, 2) modeling & profiling,
3) machine learning, and 4) acting.
