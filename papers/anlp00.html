<H3>Abstract</H3>
We describe and evaluate an implemented system for general-knowledge 
question answering. The system combines techniques for standard ad-hoc
information retrieval (IR), query-dependent text summarization, and 
shallow syntactic and semantic sentence analysis. In a series of
experiments we examine the role of each statistical and linguistic
knowledge source in the question-answering system. In contrast to
previous results, we find first that statistical knowledge of word
co-occurrences as computed by IR vector space methods can be used to
quickly and accurately locate the relevant documents for each question.
The use of query-dependent text summarization techniques, however,
provides only small increases in performance and severly limits recall
levels when inaccurate. Nevertheless, it is the text summarization 
component that allows subsequent linguistic filters to focus on relevant
passages. We find that even very weak linguistic knowledge can offer
substantial improvements over purely IR-based techniques for question
answering, especially when smoothly integrated with statistical 
preferences computed by the IR subsystems.
